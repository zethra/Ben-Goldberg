                I would call myself an outgoing, well-spoken nerd.
            </p>

            <p>
                My passion is making things. I love building electronics, building software, building robots, building
                machines.
                If I'm not working on a project, I'm looking for a new one. I am constantly researching new ways to do
                things
                and new project ideas, and looking for new inspiration. Every day I read articles and watch videos about
                new
                emerging technologies, current technology, and other things related to my field.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy talking to people, whether the topic is technology or a debate on current events. I have given
                many
                presentations, including a radio interview, at the annual County Fair where my 4-H robotics club
                exhibits
                its
                work. I am skilled at explaining technical concepts. I am also a decent salesman. Part of my pen
                business
                involved selling to the public.
