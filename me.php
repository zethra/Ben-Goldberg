                <strong>Welcome to my web site.</strong> The purpose of this site is for you to learn about me. I am
                using this site as a
                forum for describing the key influences that have made me who I am, as well as to highlight the many
                independent and team projects I have completed, illustrating my initiative and technical abilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>I would call myself an outgoing, well-spoken nerd.</strong> I intend to study Computer Science,
                possibly concentrating in cyber security or data analytics. I am applying to schools which I believe
                will provide a strong computer science curriculum, but which will also provide me exposure to computer
                engineering, entrepreneurship, and practical applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>I am self-driven and my passion is programming and making things.</strong> I love building
                software, building electronics, building robots, and building machines. If I'm not working on a project,
                I'm looking for a new one. I am constantly researching new ways to do things, and looking for new
                inspiration. Every day I read articles and watch videos about new emerging technologies, current
                technology, and other things related to my field.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>I enjoy talking to people, whether the topic is technology or a debate on current
                    events.</strong> I have given many presentations, including a radio interview, at the annual County
                Fair where my 4-H robotics club exhibits its work. I am skilled at explaining technical concepts. I am
                also a decent salesman. Part of my pen business involved selling to the public.
