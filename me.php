        <p>
            I'm an outgoing, well-spoken nerd. I am very good with computers, I write computer programs for fun, and I
            build computerized machines and electronics such as robots and 3-D printers.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am very good at articulating complex concepts. Examples:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In history class this year I played Adam Smith in a discussion about whose viewpoints on government
                systems
                was most influential. The class later voted on which character they thought was most influential, and I
                won
                by a significant amount
            </li>
            <li>I taught HTML to my 4-H club</li>
            <li>I gave a radio interview about how our 4-H club's water bottle dispensing robot works</li>
            <li>Every summer at the county 4-H fair, I present my technical projects to the public</li>
        </ul>

            What do I do
        </p>

        <p>
            My passion is making things. I love building electronics, building software, building robots, building
            machines. I am passionate about it. I'm always working on a project or looking for a new one, and sometimes
            both. I am constantly researching new ways to do things and new project ideas, and looking for new
            inspiration. I read many articles and watch many videos about new emerging technologies, current technology,
            and various other things related to my field on a daily basis. The skills I have developed as a result of my
            passion could easily be applied to a range of professions.
