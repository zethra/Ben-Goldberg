                    I started Hunterdon County's first 4-H robotics club, and I was the club's first President.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a seventh grader, after extreme disappointment over my school's Lego Mindstorms NXT robotics club
                    folding, I decided to take matters into my own hands and start my own club. I learned about 4-H,
                    but that Hunterdon County's 4-H did not have a robotics club. So I started one, in the spring of
                    2011. We started with six members and grew to twenty over two years. I was so happy to meet other
                    kids with similar interests! We were soon turning people away. We have had thirty-one different
                    members over our 4-1/2 years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was elected President for our first full year, when I was in eighth grade. I ran our meetings and
                    helped the club decide on projects. For our first year's community service project, we all brought
                    our robots to a local assisted living home, and we presented them to the residents. They loved us!
                    As the club grew, I mentored some of the younger members. As Corresponding Secretary for the club's
                    second year, I learned HTML in high school and decided to build a club web site. I also taught an
                    HTML class to my clubmates.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By this time, Robostorm had taken on a life of its own. We had more parents who agreed to become
                    leaders, and who brought their technical experience to the club. After our first two years focusing
                    on the Lego NXT platform, we were being introduced to the Arduino microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi
                    computer, mechanical design, programming, and wiring and soldering. These influences put me on a new
                    trajectory as a sophomore. The substance, sophistication, and complexity of the projects I took on
                    were at a new level. In the "Projects" section of this site, please read about some of the
                    projects I have worked on win the club.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every year since I started Robostorm, I have spent a portion of my summer preparing for and
                    participating in the 5-day exhibition at the Hunterdon County 4-H Fair. During the fair my club and
                    I demonstrate our various robotics and technology projects to the community, which we have prepared
                    in the months prior. Some of my best projects were prepared for the 4-H fair.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Looking back I am amazed at what Robostorm has become, and that it would not have existed, had I
                    just walked away from the news of no robotics in seventh grade. I feel that the influence and impact
                    of this experience on all of the club members and families has been significant. The club still
                    thrives. It has provided a place for technology-minded children across the county to find friends
                    and to experiment and explore interesting technology-oriented projects.
