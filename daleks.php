                    I joined my high school FIRST robotics team as a Sophomore, and continued with the team through
                    Junior and Senior years. Team 3637, the Daleks, is now entering its sixth year competing and each
                    year we are more successful. Being a Dalek has been a very meaningful and focusing experience for
                    me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a Junior I put my energy into solving a problem that the team had not yet addressed. When teams
                    are competing, there is a need to "scout" out the strengths and weaknesses of the other teams'
                    robots and use that information to help our robot drivers determine their game play strategy for
                    each match. I made it my mission to develop a Scouting application that would bring our team's
                    success to a new level.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I led this initiative on my own, resulting in our team having its first automated scouting
                    application for collecting and analyzing team performance.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>I worked with teammates on initial design decisions, and on what data to collect and analyze,
                            based on game rules and scoring.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I helped three teammates prototype the web GUI who were learning HTML.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I designed and coded the entire application.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Twenty of my teammates were trained on how to use the application.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I designed the operation and the IT configuration used during the tournaments.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is my most substantial and proud accomplishment. In the "Projects" section of this site, please
                    read about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a Senior, I have been appointed to the position of Director of Scouting and Scouting Software on
                    the team's executive board, reporting to the Tech VP. My goal this year is to enhance the Scouting
                    application so that it can be more easily configured to apply to each year's new game. A new FIRST
                    game will be announced in January, which the robot will be built to play. This means a new game play
                    strategy and new data collection and analysis will be required. With the improvements I plan to
                    make, others will be able to easily adapt the application each year, and the team will be able to
                    benefit from its analytics.
