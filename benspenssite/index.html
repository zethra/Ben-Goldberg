    <h1>
    See Me Every Saturday at the Stangl 
    Factory Market in Flemington
    </h1>
	<h2>
I am Ben Goldberg, a local high school student, and I am the owner of Ben's Pens.  
<br>I hand craft artisan pens out of various types of exotic and unusual woods. <br><br>

At Ben's Pens, we currently sell three 
kinds of pens:  Slim Line pens which are slim and lightweight, 
Cigar pens which are thicker and slightly longer, and Sierra pens
which are right in between. The Slim Line and Cigar pens are each made from two
pieces of wood that meet at the center where the pen twists. The Sierra pens
are each made with a single longer piece of wood. <br><br>

To make a pen, I first carefully hand-pick pieces of wood to use, then I prepare them for the lathe.  
As I turn the wood, and apply the finish, the natural beauty of the grain and
figure is revealed.  As a final touch I select the pen's metal parts in a color that
best compliments the beautiful wood. Ben's Pens are just as much works of art as they are writing tools! <br><br>
I look forward to seeing you at the Stangl Market.
